Derivative.py contains the two functions:

1.  __new__ from Derivative class, which is modified to store the expr in array 'derarr' and after recursion,
    STEP is printed.
    Line 8, 9, 10, 132, 134, 177-183

2.  _eval_derivative from Mul.py
    which modifies the mul operation for this case.
    

This is just a prototype, this is to be reformed more for the all cases of derivation. This is just the start.
Attached are the images of the result of some derivatives.
